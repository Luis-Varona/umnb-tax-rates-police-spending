# data_xlsx

Contains cleaned GNB data on budget expenditures, budget revenues, comparative
demographics, and tax bases from 2000&#x2013;2004 and 2006&#x2013;2018, as well
as policing provider data from 2024. Results from 2005 and 2019&#x2013;2022 is
excluded due to missing/improperly entered data. (We may work with the GNB and
the UMNB to correct this in the future.)

See `cleaning_scripts/clean_all_data.py` for more details on the data cleaning
pipeline and logic.
