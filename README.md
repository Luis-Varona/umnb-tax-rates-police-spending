# umnb-tax-rates-police-spending

[![PEP8](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-pep8-orange.svg)](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)

A fixed-effects regression analysis of the impact of municipal police spending
on tax rates, conducted for the Union of Municipalities of New Brunswick
(UMNB). Annual Government of New Brunswick (GNB) data from 2000&#x2013;2004 and
2006&#x2013;2018 on budget expenditures & revenue, comparative demographics,
and tax bases is integrated into the model. (2024 policing provider data is
mapped backwards to municipal jurisdictions from previous years.)
