# data_pipeline/helper_scripts/xlsx_to_clean

Contains helper scripts used in the data cleaning process. Each script is to be
called by the main executable, [xlsx_to_clean.py](../../xlsx_to_clean.py).
Unprocessed data is taken from the [data_xlsx](../../data_xlsx) directory, and
output files are saved in [data_clean](../../data_clean).
