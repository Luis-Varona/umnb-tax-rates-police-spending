# data_pipeline/helper_scripts/clean_to_final

Contains helper scripts used to isolate the final data. Each script is to be
called by the main executable, [clean_to_final.py](../../clean_to_final.py).
Cleaned (but extraneous) data is taken from the [data_clean](../../data_clean)
directory, and output files are saved in [data_final](../../data_final).
